A little bit about myself...

I am senior at [Carleton Univeristy](https://carleton.ca/) studying a double undergaduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science.

With my diverse background in cognitive science, marketing, graphic design, a passion for both tech and personal growth, I bring a range of skills to the exciting world of software development.

I also love working on my leadership skills, and been fortunate enough to pioneer and be the president for two clubs at my university: the [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/) (Carleton University Chapter), and the Carleton University Music Club.

When I'm not immersed in my professional and academic pursuits, you can find me spending time outdoors, playing basketball/volleyball, and I also have a passion for photography and [music](https://soundcloud.com/saurabh-kishore).



In no particular order, here are some of my achievements/projects that I have worked on:

- Wrote a script to automate booking a time slot for gyms across the city of Ottawa [[+]](https://github.com/gksaurabh/OttawaGym-BookingAutomation)
